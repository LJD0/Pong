# Pong 

This is a simple Pong game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to bounce a ball back and forth between two paddles while trying to prevent the ball from passing your paddle. Each time the opponent misses the ball, you earn a point. The first player to reach the winning score of 10 points wins the game.

## How to Play
- Use the W and S keys to move the left paddle up and down, respectively.

- The game will automatically reset and display the winner once one of the players reaches the winning score.


## Dependencies
To run the game, you need to have Python 3.10 installed, along with the Pygame library.

## Running the Game
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install pygame.
Execute the script by running the pong.py file in your Python environment.

## Game Rules
